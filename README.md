# DobbyBot
Dobby is an experimental Discord bot/servant/comrade.

# Installation
This bot is written to run on top of node.js. Please see https://nodejs.org/en/download/

Once you have NodeJS installed, running `npm install` from the bot directory should install all required packages. If this command prints errors, the bot won't work!

# Running
Before the first run you will need to create an `config.json` file. A bot token is required. See `config.sample.json`.

To start the bot just run
`node index.js`.
